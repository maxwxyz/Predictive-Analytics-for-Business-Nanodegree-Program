    "\n",
    "You recently started working for a company as a supply chain analyst that creates and sells video games. Many businesses have to be on point when it comes to ordering supplies to meet the demand of its customers. An overestimation of demand leads to bloated inventory and high costs. Underestimating demand means many valued customers won't get the products they want. Your manager has tasked you to forecast monthly sales data in order to synchronize supply with demand, aid in decision making that will help build a competitive infrastructure and measure company performance. You, the supply chain analyst, are assigned to help your manager run the numbers through a time series forecasting model.\n",
