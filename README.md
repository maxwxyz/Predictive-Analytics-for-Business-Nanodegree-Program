# Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree
Projects for the Udacity Nanodegree program *Predictive Analytics for Business*.

## Problem Solving with Analytics

In this project, you will analyze a business problem in the mail-order catalog business. You're tasked with predicting how much money your company can expect to earn from sending out a catalog to new customers. This task will involve building the model and applying the results in order to provide a recommendation to management.

## Data Wrangling

This project is the first part of a two-part series. In the first part, you will blend and format data and deal with outliers.

For the second part, you will use your cleaned up dataset to create another linear regression model. The difference this time is that you will have to choose which variable(s) are the most important for the model using new techniques learned in the Selecting Predictor Variables section.

## Classification Models

You are a loan officer at a young and small bank (been in operations for two years) that needs to come up with an efficient solution to classify new customers on whether they can be approved for a loan or not. You'll use a series of classification models to figure out the best model and provide a list of creditworthy customers to your manager.

## A/B Testing

You're a business analyst for Round Roasters, a coffee restaurant in the United States of America. The executive team conducted a market test with a new menu and needs to figure whether the new menu can drive enough sales to offset the cost of marketing the new menu. Your job is to analyze the A/B test and write up a recommendation to whether the Round Roasters chain should launch this new menu.

## Time Series Forecasting

You're a supply chain analyst that creates and sells video games. our manager has tasked you to forecast monthly sales data in order to help plan out the supply with demand for the company's video games.

## Segmentation and Clustering

Segmentation and Clustering are effective methods for finding patterns in your data. In this course, you learn how to prepare data to be clustered appropriately and interpret results.
