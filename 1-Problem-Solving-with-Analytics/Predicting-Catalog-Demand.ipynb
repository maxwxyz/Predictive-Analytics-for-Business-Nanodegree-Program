The company has 250 new customers from their mailing list that they want to send the catalog to.\n",

    "First, the data was explored to clean the data and find relationships. Therefore, scatterplots with two variables provide sufficient insights. The following graph shows that there is no linear relation between the average sales and the ZIP code, so we do not need the incorporate this variable into the model. The same is true for the years as customer. There seems a linear relationship between the avg.number of products and the price. The customer segment was also added to the model as it is present in both, the new customer and past customer data. An Alteryx analysis showed, that for only the chosen variables, the p-value was smaller than 0.05. This indicates that there is a linear relationship between these predictor variables and the target variable."
